# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Python
This Python code implements a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Users input their choice, and the computer generates a random choice. The game tracks the number of rounds played, player wins, and computer wins. The code is structured with functions, error handling for invalid inputs, and a loop for multiple game rounds. The game results and statistics are displayed at the end, and the program gracefully exits.
# How to Play:
<br>- Enter 1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, or 3 for Scissors.
<br>- See the outcome of your choice against the computer's.
<br>- Type 1 to play another round or 2 to exit.
<br>- Track rounds, player wins, and computer wins.
<br>- View overall statistics when you're done.
